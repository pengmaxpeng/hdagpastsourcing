Novartis,"Subject: Leveraging Data Analytics to Drive Novartis' Strategic Goals

Dear Vas,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Joshua Gillett, representing the Harvard Undergraduate Data Analytics Group (HDAG), a non-profit student organization at Harvard College. Our mission is to help organizations make data-driven decisions and achieve their strategic goals by translating data into meaningful and actionable insights. As the CEO of Novartis, a pioneer in the pharmaceuticals industry, you're undoubtedly aware of the value of data analytics in driving initiatives in areas such as cardiovascular research, immunology, neuroscience, solid tumors, hematology, chemistry, xrna, radioligand, and gene & cell therapy. 

We have had the privilege of partnering with diverse organizations from Coca-Cola to the World Health Organization. I would like to share with you a case study of our work with Red Hat. HDAG trained models across various hyperparameters and accelerators to identify optimal hardware fits. This project was part of Red Hat’s open source initiatives, focusing on Hardware Analytics workstream, utilizing X-ray image data from the Stanford Linear Accelerator and employing the CookieNet autoencoder model. The work began with a GPU demonstration of model inference and expanded to include analysis on other accelerators. 

We believe that a collaboration between Novartis and HDAG could yield similar, if not greater, results. I would love to explore potential engagement opportunities. Can we schedule a brief call in the next couple of business days to discuss how we can support your goals? I’m happy to accommodate any schedule that works best for you.

Warm regards,

Biolab Farmacêutica,"Dear Cleiton,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Joshua Gillett, and I represent the Harvard Undergraduate Data Analytics Group (HDAG). Our mission at HDAG is to assist organizations, such as yours, in making informed, data-driven decisions that can drive your strategic objectives.

Biolab Farmacêutica has made significant strides in the pharmaceuticals industry and we have taken note of the advanced technologies you utilize, like Sendgrid, Outlook and Google Tag Manager, to name a few. We understand that as the CEO, you might be facing challenges in making sense of the vast amounts of data generated and how to best use it for decision making. HDAG can provide you the insights you need to make the most out of your data.

To highlight our capabilities, HDAG had the privilege of partnering with QuartzBio, a subsidiary of Precision for Medicine. We successfully streamlined their business processes and enhanced their decision-making capabilities through data visualization and automation. The project primarily focused on automating reporting and dashboard generation for business intelligence and implementing data analytics-driven automation for monthly financial processes. We believe that a similar approach could significantly benefit Biolab Farmacêutica.

I would be delighted to explore potential engagement opportunities between Biolab Farmacêutica and HDAG. Please let me know if you or a colleague would be available for a brief call in the next couple of business days to discuss how we can support your goals. I’m happy to accommodate any schedule that works best for you.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to the possibility of working together.

Best regards,

HDAG's unique expertise and diverse project portfolio can provide invaluable support in tackling these challenges.

We have had the privilege of working with esteemed organizations like Coca-Cola, the World Health Organization, and Hewlett-Packard.

This involved evaluating potential applications within the verticals of ""Perceive,"" ""Predict,"" ""Recommend,"" and ""Categorize"". The outcome was a selection of high-value use cases, comprehensive presentations detailing findings, and technical deliverables including a code repository and curated datasets. This project demonstrated our capabilities in research, data analysis, and model creation using NLP and machine learning methods.

I am confident that a collaboration between Farmacias Peruanas and HDAG could yield significant benefits. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss potential engagement opportunities further.
